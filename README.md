Data Science internship Week 1 project - Student performance analysis
#  Week 1 - Student Performance Project

Hi! I'm Muhammad Ali. This is my first ever data science project as part of my internship at NSP Nexus.

##  About This Project

I worked with a student exam score dataset.  
The goal was to check how things like gender, lunch type, and test preparation affect students' marks in Math, Reading, and Writing.

I used:
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for handling data
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for making simple graphs

##  What’s Inside

- `StudentPerformance_Week1_Project.ipynb` → my Python notebook with all the code and graphs.
- `README.md` → this file.

##  What I Found

- Girls scored better in reading and writing.
- Students who took a test prep course did better overall.
- Students with standard lunch scored a little higher.
- Most reading scores were between 50 and 80.
